## How to use VCSV? 

As mentioned above, this library is meant to be used with VStats. With VCSV, users can easily convert data into arrays, which can then be inputted into VStats functions. 

All the methods in VCSV are <samp>static</samp>, so they can be called without creating VCSV objects. This works similar to the Java Math library.
