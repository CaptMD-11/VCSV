## How to use VCSV? 

As mentioned above, this library is meant to be used with VStats. With VCSV, users can easily convert data into arrays, which can then be inputted into VStats functions. 

There are 2 editions of VCSV: VCSVLocal and VCSVWeb. VCSVLocal is meant for analyzing CSV files where the user has a local copy of them on their machine. VCSVWeb is meant for analyzing CSV files that are located on the web. 

All the methods in both VCSV libraries are <samp>static</samp>, so they can be called without creating VCSV objects. This works similar to the Java Math library.
